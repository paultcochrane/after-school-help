    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_(ride)) is an amusement ride sometimes found at carnivals and amusement parks. It consists of a large wheel-like structure with gondolas attached at the wheel's rim, similar to a Ferris wheel. The wheel initially starts out horizontal (the plane of the wheel being parallel to the plane of the ground) however, after a certain rotational speed has been reached, the wheel lifts to the vertical (the plane of the wheel being perpendicular to the plane of the ground). This means that the gondolas at the top of the wheel are upside down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider such an amusement ride with a diameter of 22m. Calculate both algebraically and numerically the minimum speed, $v_\\mathrm{min}$, that this ride must have so that a passenger in a gondola at the wheel's highest point does not fall onto the gondola's roof.\n",

    "## Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The force keeping the passengers on a circular path is the [centripetal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force).  A passenger in a gondola experiences the feeling of being pushed outwards, away from the wheel's hub, and into the floor of the gondola.  The force that the passengers experience is called the [centrifugal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force), which is a fictitious force experienced by objects within rotating systems and acts radially away from the axis of rotation (i.e. outwards, away from the wheel's hub). Since we wish to consider the experience of a passenger in one of the gondolas (i.e. in one of the rotating frames of reference), it is useful (and relevant) in this case to consider the magnitude of the centrifugal force, which we will denote by $F_c$.  The passenger also experiences a force due to gravity (i.e. their weight) which is directed vertically downwards towards the earth; this force we denote by $F_g$.  When the magnitude of the centrifugal force is equal to the weight of the passenger, then they will remain in their gondola at the wheel's highest point and thus won't fall onto the gondola's roof.  In other words, we need to find the velocity when $F_c = F_g$.\n",

    "A point on the wheel's rim starts at an initial position $\\mathbf{r_i}$ and with an initial *velocity* $\\mathbf{v_i}$ (remember, velocity is a vector, hence it has a direction, whereas speed is just the magnitude of the velocity).  After a time $\\Delta t$, this point on the wheel's rim has moved to a final position $\\mathbf{r_f}$, and now has a final velocity of $\\mathbf{v_f}$ (but remember that its speed is still $v$).  The radius vector rotates in the time $\\Delta t$ through an angle $\\Delta \\theta$.  Note that the radius vector $\\mathbf{r_i}$ is perpendicular to its corresponding velocity vector $\\mathbf{v_i}$ and that the radius vector $\\mathbf{r_f}$ is perpendicular to its corresponding velocity vector $\\mathbf{v_f}$.  If we draw the radius vectors, we see that there's a vector from the tip of $\\mathbf{r_i}$ to $\\mathbf{r_f}$ which we'll call $\\mathbf{\\Delta r}$.  These vectors form a triangle.\n",
