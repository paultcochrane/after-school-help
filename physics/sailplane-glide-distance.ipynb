    "There are a few things to note before we dig in here:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A large component of the question is just converting between quantities of different units.\n",
    "  - There is some implicit knowledge required here, which is unfortunately not mentioned as part of the question.  In particular it's necessary to know beforehand the number of feet in one nautical mile.\n",
    "  - The numbers given as possible answers are only *approximate*; they will *not* correspond to exact distances in feet.  That this is the case is only clear when one knows how many feet there are in one nautical mile (to be mentioned later).\n",
    "  - The words \"sailplane\" and \"glider\" can be used interchangeably and refer to the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, let's analyse the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The glide ratio tells us how many units of distance a glider can fly forwards for every unit of altitude that it loses.  In the case we have here, the glide ratio is 23:1 meaning that, if we use the units of metres, the glider will fly 23 metres forwards for every metre of altitude that it loses.  Another way of looking at it: if your glider is 1 m above the ground, then you will be able to fly 23 m before hitting the ground.  This calculation also works for other units (as is the case in this example).  Thus, for every foot of altitude we lose, we can fly forwards 23 feet or, equivalently, for every 23 nautical miles we travel forwards, we will lose 1 nautical mile of altitude.  Note that the units for the forward distance and the altitude loss have to be the same for this to give a ratio, which is a unitless quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also understand this situation graphically via the drawing below, where $\\Delta l$ is the distance the aircraft travels forward and $\\Delta h$ is the altitude the aircraft loses over that horizontal distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Drawing of glide ratio](glide-ratio-drawing.png)\n",
    "(Source: [Glide ratio, lift-to-drag and their (in)dependence on aircraft weight](https://gronskiy.com/posts/glide-ratio-lift-to-drag-and-weight/), Alexey Gronskiy)\n",
    "\n",
    "One difficulty with the question is that we're given a distance in nautical miles but have to calculate an altitude loss in feet.  We therefore have the choice of converting the 8 nautical miles horizontal distance into feet at the beginning, or we keep using nautical miles the whole way through the calculation and convert to feet at the end.  Alternatively, we could just do everything algebraically and only enter numbers (and do any unit conversions) at the end; let's do it that way now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The algebraic path\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the algebraic path (which is a bit more general and doesn't require us to juggle big numbers the whole time) is probably the more physicist-like approach.  I mean, why do heaps of hard work when we can just move symbols around to get the answer, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the relationship that the glide ratio is 23:1 (i.e. 23/1).  We know that the glide ratio is equal to the distance travelled divided by the altitude lost, hence we have this relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta l}{\\Delta h} = \\frac{23}{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the glide ratio is *unitless*, which means that $\\Delta l$ and $\\Delta h$ have to be in the *same units*, i.e. if $\\Delta l$ is in nautical miles, then (and it doesn't matter how silly the numerical value looks) $\\Delta h$ *must also* be in nautical miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been given $\\Delta l$ in the question (8 nautical miles) and therefore have to solve this equation for $\\Delta h$, the altitude loss.  Solving the above equation for $\\Delta h$ goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta l}{\\Delta h} &=& \\frac{23}{1} && \\text{(multiply by $\\Delta h$)}\\\\\n",
    "\\Rightarrow \\Delta l &=& 23 \\cdot \\Delta h && \\text{(divide by 23)}\\\\\n",
    "\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\Delta l}{23} &=& \\Delta h && \\text{(rearrange to put $\\Delta h$ on the left-hand side)}\\\\\n",
    "\\Rightarrow \\Delta h &=& \\frac{\\Delta l}{23}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now calculate what $\\Delta h$ must be numerically.  Using $\\Delta l = $ 8 nautical miles, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta h = 23/8 = 0.3478 \\text{ nautical miles (to 4 decimal places)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so how far is this in feet?  By looking up the [Wikipedia page for the nautical mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile), we have the relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1 \\text{ nautical mile} \\approx 6,076 \\text{ feet}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this value is only approximate because there are probably a few inches involved in the unit conversion that aren't being specified here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now just need to convert $\\Delta h$ from nautical miles into feet.  We do this by multiplying the value we got for $\\Delta h$ by the conversion factor from nautical miles to feet, in other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\Delta h &=& 0.3478 \\text{ nautical miles}\\\\\n",
    "&=& 6076 \\cdot 0.3478 \\text{ feet}\\\\\n",
    "&=& 2113.3913 \\text{ feet}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This value doesn't equal any of the given options in the question, nevertheless, it's *closest* to answer (b), therefore we conclude that the answer is (b) 2,100 feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why can we make this conclusion confidently?  Well, the conversion from nautical miles to feet isn't a \"round\" number (i.e. a number ending in a '0'); also the relationship between 23 (from the glide ratio) to 8 (the horizontal distance travelled in nautical miles) also means that they don't divide into each other cleanly.  Therefore, none of the values here are going to give the kinds of clean, \"round\" numbers that are provided as possible answers in the question.  Thus we can conclude that it's more important for the provided answer to be within 1--2 significant digits of what one calculates exactly rather than providing an exact value in the question."
