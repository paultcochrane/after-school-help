    "A [Californian sea-lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_sea_lion) at the [Hannover Zoo](https://www.zoo-hannover.de/en) tows an inflatibile orca behind it and has jumped out of the water, reaching the top of its trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - (a) Given that the sea-lion has reached a height of `replace-me` m, what must have been the sea-lion's speed in the vertical direction as it left the water?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - (b) Is it possible to work out from the image information alone how high the sea-lion has jumped?  The camera used for the photo was a [Canon EOS 1100D](https://cameradecision.com/specs/Canon-EOS-1100D), which has sensor dimensions of `replace-me`.  The photo used a focal length of 116 mm and had a resolution of `replace-me` x `replace-me` pixels.  We assume that the width of the sea-lion in the image is approximately 46 cm (which is approximately the [maximum width of a Californian sea-lion](https://www.dimensions.com/element/california-sea-lion-zalophus-californianus)).  How wide is the sea-lion in units of camera pixels?\n",

    "  - (c) Describe the differences in the shape of the trajectory, had the sea-lion *not* been towing the inflatible orca.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - (d) The sea-lion weighs 390 kg; if it weighed 470 kg (and given the same speed out of the water), how high would it have jumped out of the water?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - (e) The optimal angle to jump out of the water is 45Â° (extra: show why).  What is the horizontal speed of the sea-lion as it jumps out of the water?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - (f) How far does the sea-lion travel through the air in the horizontal direction?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - (g) How far does the sea-lion travel along its trajectory?"
