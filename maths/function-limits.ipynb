So what can we find out about the function in order to get a feeling for what value the function approaches as $h$ approaches zero?  Well, we can start plugging values of $h$ into the function to see what value we get for smaller and smaller values of $h$.  Let's do that now by defining the function in a way so that we can use the computer to calculate the value of $h$ for us:"
